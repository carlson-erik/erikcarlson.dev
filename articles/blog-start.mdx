First and foremost, welcome to my first blog post! I've never had a blog before,
but in 2025, I'm starting one. You might ask "Why Erik? Why in 2025 would you 
want to start a blog?" Honestly, those are all valid questions that I've been 
asking myself. Let's get into it!

## Why in 2025 would you want to start a blog?
Before we talk about modern times, we should first focus on where it all started. 
I'm part of a generation that has been lucky enough to have the internet for
nearly its entire existence. Computers have always been a part of my life. It
started when I built my first computer with my dad in 2000. The PC we built 
was very simple and nothing glamorous, but it ignited a passion in me that still
burns to this day. It represented curiousity and never ending fun. My first
memories are of me playing flash games on Miniclip and finding funnypictures 
(probably one of the first iterations of modern memes) on eBaum's World. For a
while, that's what using the internet was for me. I was young and didn't quite
understand what I had at my finger tips. As I got older, I saw the potential
and it fueled a passion to learn in me.

## Isn't a blog a dead platform?
